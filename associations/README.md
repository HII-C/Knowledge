* create_labevents_umls:
    * creates a labevents table("derived.labevents_UMLS") where the ITEMID is replaced by its corresponding CUI
via the create_labevents_UMLS method

    * both the the output table("labevents_UMLS") and complimentary mappings table("derived.ItemIdToCUI") are dropped

    * a new mappings table("derived.ItemIdToCUI") is generated from an older mappings table("derived.ItemIdToCUI")

    * ***UNKNOWN: HOW THE OLD MAPPING WAS GENERATED I THINK SUSANA MAY HAVE MADE IT BUT I AM NOT SURE***

    * new labevents table("derived.labevents_UMLS") is generated by running a left join on the input table("mimic.LABEVENTS")
with the new mappings table("derived.ItemIdToCUI") on the "ITEMID" attribute.

* create_labevents_UMLS_all:
    * creates a labevents table("derived.labevents_UMLS") where the ITEMID is replaced by its corresponding CUI
via the create_labevents_UMLS_all method

    * both the the output table("labevents_UMLS") and complimentary mappings table("derived.ItemIdToCUI") are dropped

    * a new mappings table("derived.ItemIdToCUI") is generated from an older mappings table("derived.ItemIdToCUI")

    * new labevents table("derived.labevents_UMLS") is generated by running a left join on the input table("mimic.LABEVENTS")
with the new mappings table("derived.ItemIdToCUI") on the "ITEMID" attribute.

    * generates a complimentary table for all of LABEVENTS
