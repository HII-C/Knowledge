create_umls_cui_mapping.py
--------------------------
* create_labevents_umls:
    * creates a labevents table('derived.labevents_UMLS') where the ITEMID is replaced by its corresponding CUI
via the create_labevents_UMLS method

    * both the the output table('labevents_UMLS') and complimentary mappings table('derived.ItemIdToCUI') are dropped

    * a new mappings table('derived.ItemIdToCUI') is generated from an older mappings table('derived.ItemIdToCUI')

    * ***UNKNOWN: HOW THE OLD MAPPING WAS GENERATED I THINK SUSANA MAY HAVE MADE IT BUT I AM NOT SURE***

    * new labevents table('derived.labevents_UMLS') is generated by running a left join on the input 
    table('mimic.LABEVENTS') with the new mappings table('derived.ItemIdToCUI') on the 'ITEMID' attribute.

* create_labevents_UMLS_all:
    * creates a labevents table('derived.labevents_UMLS') where the ITEMID is replaced by its corresponding CUI
via the create_labevents_UMLS_all method

    * both the the output table('labevents_UMLS') and complimentary mappings table('derived.ItemIdToCUI') are dropped

    * a new mappings table('derived.ItemIdToCUI') is generated from an older mappings table('derived.ItemIdToCUI')

    * new labevents table('derived.labevents_UMLS') is generated by running a left join on the input 
    table('mimic.LABEVENTS') with the new mappings table('derived.ItemIdToCUI') on the 'ITEMID' attribute.

    * generates a complimentary table for all of LABEVENTS

* create_labevents_UMLS_w_VALUENUM:
    * creates a labevents table('derived.labevents_UMLS') where the ITEMID is replaced by its corresponding CUI
via the create_labevents_UMLS_all method

    * both the the output table('labevents_UMLS') and complimentary mappings table('derived.ItemIdToCUI') are dropped

    * a new mappings table('derived.ItemIdToCUI') is generated from an older mappings table('derived.ItemIdToCUI')

process_predicates.py
--------------------
* create_small_semmed:
    * creates a table that is a left join of semmed.PREDICATION and semmed.PREDICATION_AUX
    * SUBJECT_CUI, OBJECT_CUI, and PREDICATE are sourced from PREDICATION while SUBJEC_SCORE, and OBJECT_SCORE are
    sourced from PREDICATION_AUX
    * PREDICATION and PREDICATION_AUX description: https://skr3.nlm.nih.gov/SemMedDB/dbinfo.html

* build_tables:
    * creates a table 'semmed_cleaning.tmp_pred_scores' which stores all of the predicate SUBJECT AND OBJECT 
    combinations and their scores. The table is derived from small_semmed which is derived from semmed.PREDICATION and 
    semmed.PREDICATION_AUX
    * creates tables 'semmed_cleaing.<predicate>_by_pair' which is derived from 'semmed_cleaning.tmp_pred_scores'. These
    tables are the pairs of subjects and objects that occur for a specific predicate
