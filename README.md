# Knowledge

## About

This is the Knowledge repository for the HII-C project. This repository contains the scripts that process the medical source data to form an intelligent medical knowledge base. If you are looking for how this knowledge base is processed and delivered on our API, look at our [MedLearnAPI repository](https://github.com/HII-C/MedLearnAPI).

## Building

If you wish to change the default environment values and configurations, you can modify the config files provided in the data folder prior to building. Note that modules can still be loaded with custom configs at runtime. See the documentation for more details regarding important environment variables and configurations.

To build, clone this repository and install using pip:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HII-C/Knowledge.git /path/to/repository
    pip install /path/to/repository
```

The package will be installed under the name `knowledge-hiic` and root module will be named `knowledge`.

## Running

Since this repository is run as an install python package, scripts are run by calling modules. All modules in the `knowledge.model` and `knowledge.env` are runnable, so they can be run by calling them using `pyhton -m`. Note that every module requires a config file, whose parameters can be found looking at the module's documentation or config and spec files. The default config will be run if no config is specified.

```bash
    python -m knowledge.[module].[submodule] --config /path/to/config.json
```

All scripts will validate config first to minimize runtime errors. Also, modules will never delete files, drop tables, or create databases without prompting the user first unless specified otherwise in the config.

## Environment Creation

Once you have built the package, you may want to recreate the environment for a given medical dataset. This requires that you install the following data sets into MySQL:

- UMLS
- MIMIC
- RxNorm
- SNOMED

After the source data has been installed, the derived tables can be regenerated by running the `knowledge.env` module, which will create all derived tables in the order of dependency.

## Deploy

You can find scripts altered modified and specialized for unique deployment purposes (ie Agave servers) in the deploy folder. These scripts should reflect models alreadt found in the knowledge package but have been isolated in their own seperate environment for unique purposes.

## Archive

You can find old scripts from this repository stored in the archive folder. These scripts are not involved in the ongoing build of the Knowledge repository but are kept as reference to old code or as code to be implemented in the future.

## Documentation

### `knowledge.model`

These are the core models that are used to create the knowledge basis of the HII-C API. These modules can are executable and may be run multiple times under multiple configurations. Check the `data/config` folder for model configuration files used in this project.

Documenation of models:

- [association](https://github.com/HII-C/Knowledge/blob/master/docs/association.md)

### `knowledge.util`

These are little helper classes that make every-script tasks easier. The only runnable util is the dropbox util; otherwise, these are only used within other scripts.

Documentation of utilities:

- [config](https://github.com/HII-C/Knowledge/blob/master/docs/conifg.md)
- [database](https://github.com/HII-C/Knowledge/blob/master/docs/database.md)
- [print](https://github.com/HII-C/Knowledge/blob/master/docs/print.md)

### `knowledge.env`

These are a collection of scripts focused on the manipulation of data in the knowledge environment. Unlike the `knowledge.models` modules, these do not create or find new information, but rather translate, extract, and link sets of data for easier access by both the modules and API. These modules can are executable and may be run multiple times under multiple configurations. Check the `data/config` folder for environment configuration files used in this project.

### `knowledge.struct`

These are a collection of classes that represent data structures used in models. Structures are not runnable, but are used by models to organize and manipulate data.

Documenation of structures:
